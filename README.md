# x8086 Assembler Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based assembler for the x8086 architecture. It reads x8086 assembly instructions from a `buffer.txt` file, processes each instruction regardless of formatting (including spaces, tabs, and newlines), and outputs the updated values of the CPU registers and flags after executing the instructions.

## Features

- Reads x8086 assembly instructions from a `buffer.txt` file.
- Supports various instruction formats with or without spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- Simulates the execution of instructions and updates CPU registers and flags.
- Provides a clear output of the updated states of registers and flags.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of x8086 assembly language.
